			<h2>who</h2>
			<p>I learned cutting-edge coding at HackerYou, taught by the widely esteemed web developer Wes Bos and guided by a top-notch team of mentors including Brenna O'Brien. Not only did they give me the skills I need to code, they taught me how to develop them on-the-fly as the technology advances.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="why">
			<h2>why</h2>
			<p>The web is a constantly-evolving medium that presents amazing opportunities to communicate with your customers, your audience, or your followers. But you need to know how to speak the language. I speak it fluently, and I am here to help you develop and present your brand online.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="extra">
			<h2>what else</h2>
			<p>I'm a writer and a musician, too, and honing my craft in these areas for years has taught me a lot about how to develop a consistent aesthetic, how to connect with audiences, and how to stay focused and displined. These intangible skills inform all my work and will be a huge asset to those looking to build sophisticated, accessible brands.</p>
